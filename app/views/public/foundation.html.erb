<h1>The Open Banana Optimizer Foundation</h1>
<p>Help improve the Banana Optimization community! The Banana Optimizer is now open source. I have shown the source code to my cousin and you could be next! If you want to be a contributor to the Open Banana Optimizer Project, send an email to <strong><span style="font-weight:bolder;"> raylin AT berkeley DOT edu</span></strong> and tell me how I does open source (like a step by step would be nice). This offer won't last so don't delay! Act now! </p>
